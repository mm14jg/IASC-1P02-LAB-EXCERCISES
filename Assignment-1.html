      <h3>Origins of the Domestic Dog</h3>
      <p>
      The origins of the domestic dog includes the dog's evolutionary divergence from the <strong>wolf</strong>, its domestication, and its development into dog types and dog breeds. The dog is a member of the <em>genus Canis</em>, which forms part of the wolf-like canids, and was the first species and the only large carnivore to have been domesticated. The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa, as modern wolves are not closely related to the population of wolves that was first domesticated. An extinct <em>Late Pleistocene wolf</em> may have been the ancestor of the dog, with the dog's similarity to the extant gray wolf being the result of genetic admixture between the two.
     </p>
     <p>
       The genetic divergence between dogs and wolves occurred between <strong>40,000–20,000 years ago</strong>, just before or during the <em>Last Glacial Maximum</em>. This timespan represents the upper time-limit for the commencement of domestication because it is the time of divergence and <em>not</em> the time of domestication, which occurred later. The domestication of animals commenced over <strong>15,000 years ago</strong>, beginning with the grey wolf (Canis lupus) by nomadic hunter-gatherers. The archaeological record and genetic analysis show the remains of the <em>Bonn–Oberkassel</em> dog buried beside humans 14,200 years ago to be the first undisputed dog, with disputed remains occurring 36,000 years ago. It was not until 11,000 years ago that people living in the Near East entered into relationships with wild populations of aurochs, boar, sheep, and goats.

    <h3>Origins of the Domestic Cat</h3>
    <p>
      It was long thought that cat domestication was initiated in <strong>Egypt</strong>, because cats in ancient Egypt were venerated since around <strong>3100 BC</strong>. However, the earliest indication for the taming of an African wildcat (F. lybica) was found in <em>Cyprus</em>, where a cat skeleton was excavated close by a human Neolithic grave dating to around <strong>7500 BC</strong>. African wildcats were probably first domesticated in the Near East. The leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis) was tamed independently in China around 5500 BC, though this line of partially domesticated cats leaves no trace in the domestic cat populations of today.
    </p>

    <p>
       As of 2017, the domestic cat was the <em>second-most popular pet</em> in the U.S. by number of pets owned, <em>after freshwater fish</em>, with 95 million cats owned. In the United Kingdom, around 7.3 million cats lived in more than 4.8 million households as of 2019. In 1965, the country's cat population was 4.1 million.
